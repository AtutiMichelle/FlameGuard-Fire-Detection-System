# üî• FlameGuard - Fire Detection System

**FlameGuard** is a smart fire detection and alert system that combines IoT sensor data and a machine learning backend to detect and notify users about potential fire hazards in real time.  
This repository hosts the **web application** built using **Laravel** and **FilamentPHP** for dashboard management.

## üöÄ Current Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Laravel 11 project setup (`flameguard`)
- Database configuration and migration setup
- Installed and configured **FilamentPHP v4**
- Created `users` table with `role` column for role-based access control (admin / user)
- Added an `AdminUserSeeder` for creating a default admin user
- Basic project structure connected to a MySQL database

### üîß In Progress
- Building custom login and register pages (with Google OAuth planned)
- Creating role-based dashboard redirects:
  - Admin ‚Üí Filament Admin Dashboard  
  - User ‚Üí User Dashboard
